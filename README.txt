                          Virtual Lab Assistant (VLA)

  What is it?
  -----------

  The Virtual Lab Assistant is designed to be an intelligent Electrical
  Engineering laboratory assistant. The goal is to introduce students to,
  and guide them through theory and simulations BEFORE entering the lab,
  where they will be exposed to hardware. This should give them a better
  understanding of the hardware and free up the instructor to focus more
  on presenting the hardware and debugging any problems.
